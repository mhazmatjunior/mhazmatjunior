👋 Hello, I'm Muhammad Hassan Azmat!

🚀 JavaScript Enthusiast | 💻 Problem Solver | 🌱 Lifelong Learner

👨‍💻 Pursuing BSCS at UET Taxila, I've embarked on a journey fueled by my obsession with JavaScript and its transformative frameworks. With a mind wired to solve any challenge through code, I've developed solutions that streamline processes, such as creating and inserting tables in MySQL, saving valuable time and effort.

💡 My focus remains on mastering JavaScript and its expansive ecosystem, including Node.js, React.js, and React Native. Each line of code I write is a step towards honing my skills and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

📚 Continuous learning is ingrained in my DNA. Whether it's diving into the latest JavaScript innovations or exploring emerging technologies, I'm committed to staying at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech landscape.

💬 Wherever I am, you'll find code. Let's connect and collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what can be achieved with JavaScript.
